For a short sub-project, branch and make some improvements. 
If the result is satisfying, merger the brach with the master branch.



$ git brach new_branch  (create a new branch)
$ git checkout new_brach  (move to new_branch)

(now you have separate branch.)
$ git status 


Then make some changes to the new branch.
Commit your changes to the branch. 

After you're done with it, you may want to merge it back to the master branch. 
First, move to the master branch
$ git checkout master

then, merge.
$ git merge new_branch

Finally, delete the temporary branch
$ git branch -d new_branch
